## What is Privacy Meter?

Privacy Meter is an open-source library to audit data privacy in a wide range of statistical and machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, computer vision, and natural language processing). The tool enables data protection impact assessment based on the state-of-the-art membership inference attacks. 


## Why Privacy Meter?

Machine learning is playing a central role in automated decision-making in a wide range of organizations and service providers. The data, which are used to train the models, typically contain sensitive information about individuals. Although the data in most cases cannot be released, due to privacy concerns, the models are usually made public or deployed as a service for inference on new test data. For a safe and secure use of machine learning models, it is important to have a quantitative assessment of the privacy risks of these models, and to make sure that they do not reveal sensitive information about their training data. This is of great importance as there has been a surge in the use of machine learning in sensitive domains such as medical and finance applications.

Data Protection regulations, such as GDPR and AI governance frameworks, require personal data to be protected when used in AI systems, and that the users have control over their data and awareness about how it is being used. For example, [Article 35 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/) requires organizations to systematically analyze, identify and minimize the data protection risks of a project, especially when the project involves innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Thus, proper mechanisms need to be in place to quantitatively evaluate and verify the privacy of individuals in every step of the data processing pipeline in AI systems.

## Overview
Privacy Meter is a versatile tool that can be used with different types of models, datasets and privacy games, which all need to be specified in a `.yaml` configuration file. The description of the configuration file can be found [here](configs/README.md).

## Auditing Methodology
Privacy Meter encompasses multiple privacy auditing method by considering various sources of information leakage. 
- For information leakage through training points, we recommend using [membership inference](documentation/mia.md). 
- For information leakage in the vicinity of training points, [range membership inference](documentation/ramia.md) should be used. 
- For information leakage in the percentage of dataset used in training the given models, [dataset usage cardinality inference](documentation/duci.md) is the go-to method. 
- Privacy meter also supports [auditing the differential privacy (DP) lower bounds](documentation/dpaudit.md) of (DP or non-DP) training algorithms with membership inference attacks. 

The specific details of each inference attack and how to use them in Privacy Meter can be found by clicking the respective link above. Privacy Meter extends the basic auditing approach that uses membership inference by incorporating more modern and advanced auditing strategies. Refer to the diagram below for a quick guide of which class of inference attack should be used for different auditing purposes.

## Installation Instructions
### From GitHub ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-000?logo=github&logoColor=fff) (Recommended)
You can directly clone this GitHub repository to your device. To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, if you prefer using conda, you can create a new environment using the provided `env.yaml` file:
```
conda env create -f env.yaml
```
This should create a conda environment named `privacy_meter` and install all necessary libraries in it. If conda takes too much time (more than a few minutes) to solve the environment, we suggest updating the conda default solver by following this official [article](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community).

### From PyPI ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-2088FF?logo=pypi&logoColor=white)
Privacy Meter is available as a package on PyPI. To install it from the PyPI version, do
```
pip install privacy-meter
```

### Use Privacy Meter on cloud platforms
If you want to use this tool on cloud platforms, the simplest way is to follow the instructions above to clone the code and install the environment. We additionally provide Jupyter notebooks for auditing with [mia](demo_notebooks/demo.ipynb), [ramia](demo_notebooks/demo_ramia.ipynb) or [duci](demo_notebooks/demo_duci.ipynb), which can be run with the cloud computing resources from Google once uploaded to Colab ![Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google_Colab-F9AB00?style=plastic&logo=google-colab&logoColor=white). For a quick start, you can follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/privacytrustlab/ml_privacy_meter/blob/master/demo_notebooks/demo.ipynb) to do a demo run of the auditing using MIA. 

If you prefer to use it on AWS ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-232F3E?style=flat&logo=amazonwebservices&logoColor=white), please refer to the instructions [here](documentation/cloudformation.md). This document explains how to use multiple graphics cards (GPUs) at the same time to speed up the training process.

## Dataset and models

Privacy Meter can be used with all datasets and model classes. Here, we provide examples of using Privacy Meter on CIFAR10 (`cifar10`), CIFAR100 (`cifar100`), Purchase (`purchase100`), Texas (`texas100`), and AG News (`agnews`). In terms of models, we provide examples for CNN (`cnn`), AlexNet (`alexnet`), WideResNet (`wrn28-1`, `wrn28-2`, `wrn28-10`), MLP (`mlp`), and GPT-2 (`gpt2`) models. To specify the dataset and model, you can use the `dataset` and `model_name` parameters in the configuration file. Sample configurations have been provided in the `configs` folder for Purchase-100, CIFAR-10 and AG News datasets.

### Extending to Other Datasets and Models
#### Attacking LLMs with other datasets

To use other datasets supported by HuggingFace's `datasets` library, after specifying it in the configuration file, you need to additionally follow these steps:
- Create `/dataset/<hf_dataset>.py`: this file handles the loading and preprocessing of the new huggingface dataset. You can refer to `/dataset/agnews.py` for an example.
- Modify `/dataset/utils.py` to include the new dataset in the `get_dataset` function.

For other datasets, you can simply modify the `get_dataset` function in `/dataset/utils.py` to support loading the new dataset.

#### Attacking other transformers

To attack other transformers from Hugging Face's `transformers` library, you need to modify `/models/utils.py` to include the new model in the `get_model` function.  If you want to use different training pipelines, you can modify `/trainers/train_transformer.py` accordingly. You can also use other PEFT methods in the same file if you want to use more than LoRA.

For other Pytorch models, you can create a new model architecture in `/models/` and modify the `get_model` function in `/models/utils.py` to include the new model.

#### Use custom training scripts

We integrate a fast training library, [hlb-CIFAR10](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10), developed by [tysam-code](https://github.com/tysam-code), into Privacy Meter as an example of incorporating custom training scripts. This library achieves an impressive training accuracy of 94% on CIFAR-10 in approximately 6.84 seconds on a single A100 GPU, setting a new world speed record. This integration allows users to efficiently evaluate the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm against existing attack algorithms using the CIFAR-10 dataset. To leverage this fast training library, simply specify the `model_name` as `speedyresnet` in the configuration file. 

To use other training scripts, you can refer to how `speedyresnet` and `/trainers/fast_train.py` is integrated into Privacy Meter for an example.

### Auditing Trained Models

By default, the Privacy Meter checks if the experiment directory specified by the configuration file contains `models_metadata.json`, which contains the model path to be loaded. To audit trained models obtained outside the Privacy Meter, you should follow the file structure (see `<log_dir>/<models>` in the next section) and create a `models_metadata.json` file that shares the same structure as the one generated by Privacy Meter. You can also run the demo configuration file with a few epochs to generate a demo directory to start with.

## Audit Results
The audit results will be saved in the `log_dir` specified in the configuration file. The results include the following:
```
<log_dir>/
    ├── models/
        ├── models_metadata.json: the meta information of the run and each trained model
        ├── model_<model_id>.pkl: the trained models
        └── memberships.npy: the membership labels of the training data for each model
    ├── report/
        ├── exp/: contains attack results and (log) ROC curves for each target model    
        ├── log_time_analysis.log: log with timing information for each run
        ├── attack_result_average.csv: the aggregate attack results of the run
        └── ROC_(log_)average.png: the aggregate (log) ROC of the run
    └── signals/: contains the attack signals computed for each target and reference model, 
                    according to the attack type specified in the configuration file
```
